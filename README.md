# ags_save_parser
Library for parsing save files produced by Adventure Game Studios games

This is currently designed around saved games from "Heroine's Quest 1.2 - The Herald of Ragnarok", but would probably work for any games
using that version of AGS, and likely other versions of about the same time (~2014).  

I intend to add support for more games later.  Right now this library is intended specifically to aid in the parsing of the "honor" 
attribute from HQTHoR savegame files.
