Start at 63

Thank Volund for saving me +1 = 64
Engage monster and run = -1 each time

Convo with Jarl:
"I wish to be a hero" = +1
Answer honestly as a thief (Neutral)
Answer honestly as a fighter = +1
Don't accept the charge the first time = -1

Take tinderbox without asking = -1
Ask first - (Neutral)

Convo with Fates:
Tell the truth (inclusive of multiclass) - (Neutral)
"I want to be a hero" - (Neutral)
Ask about olympics - (Neutral)

Save Sigurd +1
Loot Sigurd's body before helping him -2

Convo with Sigurd:
Honestly say "I'm a fighter" or "Wizard" +1
Lie about your character class (Neutral)
Say "You're in my debt" +0

Give food or the scarf to Kraka +2 (only works once)

Kraka asks for a coin:
Agree (Neutral)
Refuse (Neutral)
I do not give money to beggars (Neutral)

Thief in the Room:
"I am going to kill you for this" (-2)
All other responses (Neutral)

Thieves Lodge conversation:
"I should just kill the both of you" (-2)
"I want to join the thieves lodge", then "I should kill you" (-2, so no effect)
"Pay me", "I want to join", then "I should kill you" (-2, so no effect)
"Stay away from me in the future" (Neutral)
"I want to join", "Pay me", then "Stay away" (-2)
"I want to join" then "Stay away from me" (-2)
"Pay me" then "Stay away from me" (-2)

So, in summary, any response other than immediately saying "Just stay away from me" gives you -2, but only -2 (not cumulative).  Saying "stay away" gets you out with a neutral effect to honor (no increases :/)

Return the fox to its home (+1)
Tell Hervor that Aurvendel has located Heime in Svartelfheim (+1)
Tell Lithrasir that Liff wants her to stop sending letters (-2)


Convo with fates at stone circle (Another neutral one, I'm afraid):
Answering honestly is the only way through.
Saying "I'm a mere mortal" means you have to repeat the stones puzzle, but has no effect on honor.
Lying about your character class, the world you're trying to go to, who you're seeking, or who sent you will trap you in the void.

Gold (Neutral)
Cloak (Neutral)
Key (which he refuses) (Neutral)
